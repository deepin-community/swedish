  * New policy compliant package (closes: #164256, #164270)

swedish (1.4.2-0.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Experimental package after the dictionaries policy proposal. Please
    see the policy document for details on the changes. 
    Micce, I changed the conflicts in dictionaries-common control file to
    (<=1.4.2). That way you can decide the new version number, be if 2.0.0
    as we spoke, or whatever else. I have put this pakage a NMU number 
    with debian revision even if the package is native to make that easier.
  * Removed old templates files for wswedish. All that work is currently 
    done by dictionaries-common itself. We may need some of the localized 
    templates, but since they will not be exactly the same, I prefer to
    restart from scratch.
  * Added a Pspell-Ispell entry to the iswedish.info-ispell file.

swedish (1.4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added german template (thanks Sebastian Feltel <sebastian@feltel.de>)
    (closes: #98394)
  * Reverted to use Göran Andersons list and make it a native Debian
    packet with source swedish.  It's a much more fancy way of keeping the
    wordlist, and also better!
  
  * Added some words from the ispell-sv list that I think are
    appropriate. 

 -- Mikael Hedin <micce@debian.org>  Mon, 28 May 2001 23:02:06 +0200

  * This uses the ispell-sv wordlist, a bit different from Gorans, but I
    will merge updates to ispell-sv eventually...
  * Using update-alternatives and debconf to set default dictionary
    (closes: #27956)
  * Corrected 'sekventiell' (closes: #46924)
  * Architecture: any in iswedish (closes: #76375, #76548)

    here we go.
